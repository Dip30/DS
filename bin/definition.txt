Data Structure Definition:


1) why do we need data structure?

answer: For managing data in a systematic way

2) List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler design, Operating System Design, Database Management System, Statistical Analysis, Numerical Analysis, Graphips, Artificial Intelligence, Simulation
3) what is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type

4) what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is fixed length data structure and array list is a variable length collection class
5) what is LinkedList?
Linked list is a collection of data where a current value knows the next address
6) what is queue?
Queue is a collection of data which follows first in first out
7) what is stack?
Stack is a collection of data that follows last in first out
8) what is FIFO and LIFO?
  First in, First out and Last in First out
9) what is the order of complexity?
Time complexity Space Complexity
10)what is the best case to search an element from an array?
O(1)
11)what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
O(n)
12) what is tree in data structure?
a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
13) what is graph in data structure?
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of nodes or vertices
14) what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable is synchronized, but HashMap is not.
HashTable doesnot allow null key or null value, HashMap allows one null key  and any number of null value
One of the subclass of HashMap is LinkedHashMap, but it is not easy for HashTable.
15) What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS - Array
Ntwork - Data Model v- Graph
Hierarchical Data Model - Tree

16) How HashMap works in java?
HashMap works on the principle of Hashing .  To understand Hashing , we should understand the three terms first   i.e  Hash Function , Hash Value and Bucket .
hashCode() function  which returns an integer value is the Hash function. The important point to note that ,  this method is present in Object class ( Mother of all class ) .

 This is the code for the hash function(also known as hashCode method) in Object Class :

     public native int hashCode();



The most important point to note from the above line :  hashCode method return  int value .
 So the Hash value is the int value returned by the hash function .


A bucket is used to store key value pairs . A bucket can have multiple key-value pairs . In hash map, bucket used simple linked list to store objects .



17)What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big-O notation is how programmers talk about algorithms
18)Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

19) Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of adding element.
  b)In terms of removing element.
  c)In terms of searching element.
